    Many programs, particularly web applications, expect files to be dragged
    into them now. If you don't habitually use a file manager that is a
    problem. dragon is a lightweight drag-and-drop source for X where you
    can run: dragon file.tar.gz
    to get a window with just that file in it, ready to be dragged where you
    need it.
